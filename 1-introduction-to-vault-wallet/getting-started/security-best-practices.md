# Security Best Practices

VAULT Wallet emphasizes the importance of security best practices to protect users' assets. Always store your 12-word secret phrase in a secure location, away from prying eyes. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to your account. Regularly update your password and avoid using easily guessable information. Be cautious of phishing attempts and only download the wallet from official sources. By following these practices, users can significantly enhance the security of their wallets.
