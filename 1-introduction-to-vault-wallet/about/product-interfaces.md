# Product Interfaces

The user interface of **VAULT WALLET** is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. The main dashboard provides a clear overview of the total wallet balance as well as balances across individual blockchains. Users can easily access key functions such as sending and receiving assets, transaction history, and settings. Each feature is clearly labeled and supported with tooltips and guides to ensure a smooth experience.

In addition, **VAULT WALLET** offers **customizable themes for each wallet**. Users can adjust colors and font sizes individually – for example, choosing a more minimal and professional look for a salary wallet, and a brighter, playful style for a personal spending wallet. This customization makes it easier to visually distinguish between wallets and creates a more convenient navigation experience.
