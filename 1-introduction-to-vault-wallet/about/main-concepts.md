# Main Concepts

**Wallet:** Your personal gateway to the decentralized financial landscape with VAULT Wallet. Each wallet functions as a non-custodial interface allowing you to manage your funds directly, with full control over your private keys. VAULT Wallet supports multi-chain operations, meaning you can manage and transact stablecoins across various blockchain networks such as Ethereum, BSC, Solana, and more.

**User:** Anyone who has created a wallet within VAULT Wallet. Users maintain complete autonomy over their assets and can participate in activities like transactions, staking, and managing their funds across different blockchains. A user can also have wallets set up for different purposes or in various supported blockchains.

**Staking:** A feature within VAULT Wallet that allows users to stake their cryptocurrency in return for rewards or passive income. This is facilitated through integration with leading DeFi platforms where users can engage in yield farming and other reward-generating activities.

**Transaction Policy:** A set of predefined rules that govern the execution of transactions within a user's wallet. This can include limits on transaction sizes, specific blockchain networks for transactions, or approval mechanisms for high-value transfers. Transaction policies enhance the security and compliance of operations within VAULT Wallet.

**Gasless Transactions:** VAULT Wallet supports gasless transactions in selected stablecoins across specific networks. This feature allows users to perform transactions without the need for native network tokens to pay for transaction fees, simplifying the process and enhancing user experience.

**Cross-Chain Capability:** A core functionality of VAULT Wallet that allows users to seamlessly manage and transfer assets across different blockchain networks. This is achieved through advanced smart contracts and integrations with blockchain infrastructure providers like Chainlink.

**Security Features:** VAULT Wallet employs robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure smart contracts to ensure the safety of user assets. Regular security audits and compliance checks are conducted to maintain and enhance the trustworthiness of the platform.
