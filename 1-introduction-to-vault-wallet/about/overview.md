# Overview

VAULT is a self-custodial crypto wallet designed to simplify the use of stablecoins across multiple blockchains. With Vault, users can send and receive assets **without holding native blockchain tokens for gas**, making cross-border transfers and crypto-fiat operations fast and accessible.

VAULT is available as:

* iOS app
* Android app
* Web app
* Browser extension
* Telegram Mini App

At its core, VAULT enables users to **securely generate and manage their own private keys**, ensuring full ownership of funds and transactions.

All transactions are powered by our **gasless engine**, which covers network fees on behalf of users. Instead of requiring native tokens, the system delegates blockchain energy, allowing seamless and low-friction transfers.

Users can perform up to **three free transactions per day**, with additional transactions processed at minimal cost through the delegated energy model.
