# Supported Blockchains

VAULT leverages its **gasless transaction engine** and cross-chain infrastructure to ensure seamless integration across leading blockchain networks. Our primary focus is on the platforms where **stablecoins are most actively used**, enabling frictionless transfers without requiring native tokens for gas.

VAULT currently operates on **Tron**, where the gasless model is live and available to all users. Our roadmap expands support to a wide range of blockchains, including:

* **EVM-compatible networks:** Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Base
* **Non-EVM networks:** Solana, TON, Tron

This integration strategy ensures that Vault users can manage stablecoins across the most widely adopted and trusted blockchain platforms, while enjoying **zero-gas transactions and a simplified user experience**.
