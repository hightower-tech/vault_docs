# Stake and Earn

The "Stake and Earn" feature in VAULT Wallet is designed to allow users to actively participate in staking their stablecoins to earn attractive returns, while offering an intuitive and transparent user experience. Here’s an updated description including the functionality of "Withdraw" and "Claim" buttons:

**How the Stake and Earn Process Works:**

1. **Access Staking Options:**
   * **Earn Button:** Users can initiate the staking process by selecting the "Stake" option from the main menu of VAULT Wallet. This action opens the staking module within the application.
2. **Select a Staking Pool:**
   * **Choose a Trusted Pool:** VAULT Wallet provides a curated list of trusted staking pools that offer various interest rates. Users can browse through these options and select a pool based on the stability, reputation, and yield of the pool.
   * **Review Pool Details:** Detailed information about each pool, including expected return rates, pool size, and the underlying blockchain technology, helps users make informed decisions.
3. **Enter Staking Amount:**
   * **Specify Amount:** Users enter the amount of stablecoins they wish to stake. They can manually input the amount or choose to stake all available stablecoins in their wallet.
4. **Projected Earnings Display:**
   * **Earnings Estimation:** Once the amount is entered, VAULT Wallet calculates and displays the projected earnings based on the selected pool’s current rate. Users can view their potential weekly, monthly, and annual earnings before confirming the transaction.
   * **Confirm Details:** After reviewing the projected earnings and the pool's terms, users confirm their choice by proceeding to the next step.
5. **Confirm and Stake:**
   * **Security Check:** As with other transactions, staking requires users to perform a security check, which may include entering a PIN or using biometric authentication.
   * **Transaction Execution:** Upon successful authentication, the transaction to stake the coins is executed. The stablecoins are transferred to the chosen staking pool, and the staking process begins.
6. **Manage Staking:**
   * **Withdraw Button:** This button allows users to withdraw their original staked amount plus any accrued profits from the pool. This action can be taken based on the terms set by the staking pool, such as lock-in periods or withdrawal fees.
   * **Claim Button:** Users can use the "Claim" button to retrieve only the profits earned while leaving the original staked amount in the pool. This feature is useful for users who wish to continue earning returns without ending their staking.
7. **Transaction Status and Tracking:**
   * **Status Update:** The status of the staking transaction, such as "Processing," "Staked," "Withdrawing," or "Claiming," is displayed in the user’s transaction history.
   * **Ongoing Earnings Tracking:** Users can track their earnings over time through the wallet’s interface, which updates as earnings accrue according to the staking terms.

**Benefits of the Stake and Earn Feature:**

* **User-Friendly:** Designed to be as straightforward as making a regular transaction, allowing users to stake with just a few clicks.
* **Transparency:** Provides clear, upfront information about potential returns, helping users to make well-informed financial decisions.
* **Flexibility:** Offers a range of staking options, catering to different risk appetites and investment strategies, with easy options to withdraw or claim earnings.

The updated "Stake and Earn" functionality in VAULT Wallet provides a comprehensive, secure, and profitable way for users to manage their investments, enhancing their financial assets through intuitive controls and transparent operations.
