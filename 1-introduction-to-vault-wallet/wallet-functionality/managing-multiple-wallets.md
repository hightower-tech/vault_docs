# Managing Multiple Wallets

VAULT Wallet allows users to manage multiple wallets within the same app. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to segregate their assets or manage different types of cryptocurrencies. Adding a new wallet is simple, and users can switch between wallets seamlessly. Each wallet retains its own transaction history, balances, and settings, ensuring clarity and organization. This capability provides flexibility and convenience, catering to users with diverse crypto management needs. It also enhances the overall user experience by offering comprehensive wallet management solutions.
