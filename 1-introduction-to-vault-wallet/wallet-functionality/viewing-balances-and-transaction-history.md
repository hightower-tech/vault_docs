# Viewing Balances and Transaction History

Users can view their total wallet balance and individual balances for each supported blockchain. The top of the screen displays the total balance, providing a quick snapshot of the portfolio's value. Below the balance, users can find their unique wallet addresses, which can be copied or viewed as QR codes for easy sharing. The transaction history section allows users to see all incoming and outgoing transactions. This detailed view helps users keep track of their financial activities and ensures transparency.
