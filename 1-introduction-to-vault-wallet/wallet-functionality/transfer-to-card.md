# Transfer to Card

#### Interface: Transfer to Card

The "Transfer to Card" feature in VAULT Wallet is designed to provide a streamlined and intuitive process for users to transfer cryptocurrency to a fiat card. This functionality is built to ensure a seamless user experience, from initiation to completion of the transfer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the interface and process:

1. **Initiate Transfer:**
   * **Card Button:** The user begins the transfer process by clicking on the "CARD" button in the wallet interface. This action opens the transfer module.
2. **Card Details Input:**
   * **Enter Card Number and Currency:** Users can manually enter their card number and select the desired fiat currency for the transfer. Alternatively, they can choose a previously saved card from a dropdown list, which will automatically fill in the card details and associated currency.
   * **Currency Selection:** If the card supports multiple currencies, users can select the desired currency from a dropdown menu at this stage.
3. **Amount Input:**
   * **Enter Cryptocurrency Amount:** The user inputs the amount of cryptocurrency they wish to transfer. The interface is designed to accept inputs in the specific cryptocurrency being transferred.
   * **Display Fiat Equivalent:** Once the cryptocurrency amount is entered, the interface automatically calculates and displays the equivalent amount in the selected fiat currency, considering the current exchange rate and any applicable fees.
4. **Transaction Confirmation:**
   * **Review Details:** Before proceeding, users are presented with a summary of the transaction details, including the cryptocurrency amount, fiat equivalent, card details, and total fees.
   * **Confirm Transaction:** To finalize the transfer, the user must click a "Confirm" button. This action triggers the transaction process.
5. **Transaction Status:**
   * **Status Display:** After confirmation, the interface updates to display the status of the transaction. This includes stages such as "Processing," "Sent," and "Completed."
   * **Error Handling:** If any issues arise during the transaction, the status display will show an "Error" message with a brief explanation. Users may be given the option to retry the transaction or contact support.
6. **Completion:**
   * **Successful Transfer:** On successful completion, a final screen or notification confirms that the transfer has been successfully processed, displaying the transaction details for user reference.
   * **Receipt Option:** Users have the option to share, download or email a receipt of the transaction for their records.

This interface is designed to be user-friendly, minimizing the number of steps and required inputs while ensuring transparency and security throughout the transfer process. By efficiently guiding users through each phase, VAULT Wallet enhances the overall experience, making financial transactions as effortless as possible.
