# Multi-Factor Authentication

&#x20;**VAULT Wallet prioritizes the security of user accounts with robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) measures**. Instead of relying on SMS codes, users can enhance their account security by enabling MFA through authentication apps such as Google Authenticator or Authy. This method requires users to verify their identity using a secondary device or app-generated code, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

&#x20;**During** **the account setup or through the settings, users can seamlessly enable MFA with authentication apps**. This feature adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and manage their digital assets within VAULT Wallet. By empowering users with advanced security options, VAULT Wallet reinforces its commitment to providing a secure and trustworthy platform for cryptocurrency management.

Users are encouraged to set up MFA using authentication apps and securely store their seed phrase for account recovery, enhancing the overall security posture of their VAULT Wallet experience.
