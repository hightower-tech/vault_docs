Non-custodial by design. Vault never stores your private keys or seed phrase on our servers. Keys are generated and remain under your control on your device.

1\) Scope

This Privacy Policy explains how we process personal data when you use the Vault mobile/desktop applications, Telegram Mini App, our websites, and support channels (together, the “Services”). It applies to our current TRON integration; future networks may be added.

2\) Personal Information Collection Statement (PICS)

&#x20;

Data minimization: We only collect the minimum personal data necessary to operate the Services.<br>

Device & usage data: In addition to the data listed above, we may collect limited device and app data (such as operating system version, app version, language, and time zone) solely to improve reliability, diagnose issues, and enhance security.<br>

IP addresses: Your IP address may be logged temporarily when you interact with our Services (e.g., when sending requests or transactions) for security, rate-limiting, and abuse prevention. These logs are retained only for a short period (typically 30–90 days) and then deleted.

&#x20;

What we collect

● Account identifiers: your email address (required for login, account identification, essential service communications, and sending account confirmation emails).● Wallet linkage: a mapping between your email and wallet address(es) created or added in the app, to help you manage addresses and to enable security/abuse prevention,support and debugging.● If you use our Telegram Mini App, we may receive your Telegram user ID, display name and avatar from Telegram to operate the Mini App.\

● Support content optional: messages/attachments you send to support. Please do not send seed phrases, private keys or identity documents to support.\
