#### USDT Processing on TON Blockchain

The introduction of the native USD₮ token by Tether on the TON Blockchain has significantly enhanced the utility and accessibility of stablecoins within this ecosystem. The TON Blockchain now supports USD₮ as a Jetton Asset, alongside the older jUSDT token, which remains in circulation as a secondary option. This dual support provides flexibility and choice for users engaging in stablecoin transactions on the TON network.

#### Implementing Gasless Transactions with USD₮ on TON

Sharks Wallet leverages the standard solutions provided by TON developers to implement gasless transactions for USD₮. This approach not only streamlines user transactions but also substantially reduces the cost associated with managing and transferring stablecoins.

Transaction fees for transferring USD₮ on TON are low, averaging about 0.0145 TON per transaction. This is significantly cheaper than fees on networks like Ethereum, where costs fluctuate with network load. The TON development team’s optimizations have made USD₮ transactions up to three times cheaper than other Jetton transactions on the network.

TON’s architecture allows for high throughput and rapid confirmation times, making USD₮ transactions faster and more scalable than on many other blockchains. This efficiency is crucial for users who require quick and reliable transaction processing.

Advanced Considerations:

It is important to note that in the TON Blockchain, Jettons can be created with duplicate names. Users must exercise caution and verify the legitimacy of USD₮ tokens by checking the Jetton Master address to avoid potential fraud. Sharks Wallet is engineered to automatically filter out and prevent the display of illegitimate tokens. This feature ensures that only verified and legitimate USD₮ tokens are visible and accessible to our users, providing a safer and more reliable transaction environment.
