# Multichain gasless framework

Certainly! Here's the revised introduction with the added information about implementing cost-effective gasless transactions:

#### Multichain Gasless Framework

At VAULT Wallet, we are committed to providing a seamless transaction experience across multiple blockchain networks. Our multichain gasless framework is designed to facilitate this, though the implementation varies significantly across different blockchains due to their distinct architectures and capabilities. Some blockchains offer native support for gasless transactions, allowing straightforward integration. In contrast, others require the development of complex architectures to enable similar functionalities. Notably, we have successfully implemented gasless transactions in one of the popular blockchains, where the cost is even lower than the original transactions using native tokens.\

About frameworks: [EVM](evm.md), [TRON](tron.md), [SOL](sol.md), [TON](ton.md).

**Supported Blockchains:**<br>

Our multichain gasless framework is designed to be inclusive, supporting a wide range of blockchain networks, each with its unique characteristics and advantages. Here is a list of the primary blockchains that VAULT Wallet will support:

1. **Ethereum (ETH):** Leveraging Layer 2 solutions and meta-transactions to facilitate gasless transactions within the Ethereum network.
2. **Binance Smart Chain (BSC):** Utilizing BSC’s native mechanisms for lower gas fees and enabling easier implementation of gasless features.
3. **Solana (SOL):** Known for its low-cost transactions, Solana allows for an inherently more affordable way to handle transfers, making it ideal for integrating gasless solutions.
4. **Polygon (MATIC):** Utilizes a combination of Polygon’s PoS chain and bridge services to achieve gasless transactions effectively.
5. **Avalanche (AVAX):** Incorporates Avalanche’s subnets for customized, low-cost transaction processes.
6. **TRON (TRX):** Offers inherently low transaction fees and supports a version of gasless transactions through bandwidth points.
7. **Arbitrum:** Focuses on scaling Ethereum through optimistic rollups, facilitating transactions with significantly reduced gas costs.
8. **Optimism:** Utilizes optimistic rollups to lower gas fees and simplify gasless transaction integrations.
9. **The Open Network (TON):** Employs unique blockchain structures that naturally support low-cost transactions, facilitating easier adoption of gasless frameworks.
10. **Base:** A newer blockchain designed to integrate easily with existing infrastructures while supporting innovative transaction fee mechanisms.

This diverse support ensures that users from different blockchain backgrounds can experience the benefits of gasless transactions, improving accessibility and usability across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Through the Multichain Gasless Framework, VAULT Wallet aims to reduce the barriers to blockchain adoption and enhance the overall user experience.
