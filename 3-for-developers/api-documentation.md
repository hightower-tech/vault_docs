# API Documentation

Currently, the API documentation for VAULT Wallet is under development and will be available once the API itself is finalized. Our team is dedicated to ensuring that the API is robust, secure, and meets the needs of our users and developers before releasing any documentation.

For those interested in the timeline and progress of the API development, please refer to the [API Access and Integration section](../1-introduction-to-vault-wallet/user-settings-and-customization/api-access-and-integration.md). This section provides detailed insights into our strategic plans for API rollout, features, and how we plan to support developers and partners in integrating and utilizing the API.

We appreciate your patience and interest in developing with VAULT Wallet and look forward to providing comprehensive documentation that will assist in seamless integration and innovation upon the API's completion.
